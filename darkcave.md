You step into the dark cave. The air turns damp and heavy, and each step echoes against the stone walls. Water drips steadily from the ceiling, forming small, glistening pools on the uneven ground. It's cold and wet, and the darkness seems to press in around you. Suddenly, a bat screeches and darts past your head, its wings brushing your hair as it vanishes into the shadows above. Your heart races, and you realize you're not alone in here.
